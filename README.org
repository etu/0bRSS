* 0bRSS - Simple RSS Reader

0bRSS is a Simple RSS-Reader.

** Requirements
 - PHP 5.4 or greater.
 - PostgreSQL or MySQL (InnoDB required).
 - Webserver that rewrites the URI's [[https://github.com/slimphp/Slim#setup-your-web-server][like this]].

** Installation
 - Clone the git-repo.
 - Install the composer dependencies (=php composer.phar install=).
 - Write the config-file.
 - Run the migrations (=php vendor/bin/phinx migrate -c config.php=).
 - Create user (=php bin/create-user=).

** Writing the config
Start by copying the =config.sample.php= to =config.php= and then change your
values to match your database configruation.

You may also set =bcrypt-password-cost= which will be used by the password
hashing. Higher number -> Slower but better hashing.

There is a script provided (=php vendor/bin/cost-check=) which will benchmark
a cost for you which takes 0.2s to hash a password with. On my 5 year old
laptop, it suggests 11. So most people should be able to go higher than that.
